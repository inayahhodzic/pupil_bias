This repository contains some scripts developed as part of an internship project focused on analyzing spike, behavioral, and pupil data from experimental mice. The pupil data was collected using eye-tracking technology and further analyzed in these scripts.

Note: These scripts were continuously reviewed and supported (with their own code) by my supervisor and colleagues.
